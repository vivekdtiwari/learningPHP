## Trial Attempt at Learning PHP

- Most tutorials on PHP seemed to focus on script basics too much.
- Basic PHP setup is done on local machine and this project will be an attempt to create a simple website using PHP.
- The tutorial I am following is on youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSA0atvePSI posted by Michiel Wouters
- The tutorial although little old is still pretty useful. For my trial I am using PHP7.
- Also rather than using custom styles from, I will be using bootstrap - Paper Theme found at : http://bootswatch.com/paper/
- The version of bootstrap for the Paper theme is v3 not v4. Okies onto some experimentation and learning now.
- The goal is to learn reasonable amount of PHP to be able to bugfix PHP related projects and help out on related tasks.
